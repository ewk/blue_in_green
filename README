A Vim color scheme that clones the color selection in Christoph Paulik's
Emacs theme:

Which in turn is based on Google's Material Design:

	https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#

This is a dark theme.

It does not support terminals without 256 color support.

Highlighting support depends on the syntax groups defined by Vim for each
language. For example, Vim does not define a syntax group for C variables.
Check /usr/share/vim/vim80/syntax to see what's defined for your favorite
language.
